I'm really sad seeing what's happened in the Open Source community regarding the Hacktoberfest this year.
I mean, this event was designed to promote Open Source contributing. The idea is fairly simple and laudable.
So seeing conversations about spamming and other unfair practices that's causes a lot of maintainers to 
rage against this event were really sad. I first were a bit confused and began to think about the causes of this bad advertising.
I did not understand why it exists this kind of animosity around the event that allows me to begin my Open Source journey.

# My first participation.

The first time I participated, I were not use to the process of contributing on OpenSource projects. 
To be honest, I think that I were not totally aware of what OpenSource was or the phylosophy behind this principle.

This young me were not really confident when writing a message into an issue and more precisely were terrifying to write anything on github:
Before writing a simple comment, I was thinking: damn if somebody read this and ... you know maybe is this a big shitty comment or question ... 
maybe should I avoid writing anything on github since I'm not an expert on this or this other subject.

The present me would like to say to my past me: in the future you will not be an expert of anything so, if you are waiting for it, 
you may never been able to write a simple comment or issue on github.
On the second hand: idiot, if you want to become an expert on something don't fear errors or stupid questions ... that seems to be a good way to learn.

Happily SFEIR has organized an event around the hacktoberfest.
 
I joined this event with some friends and teammates: we shared some good time contributing to each other's project and drinking some fermented beverages. 
It was really satisfying to contribute to a bunch of projects other than mine, we were able to discuss, to promote some projects and to get/give help
to each other.

By the way, I finally, proudly (or not) got the chance to be one of the chosen t-shirt owner 
Well, anyway the past me thought that way, the present me is not so proud of this:
it was a cool event, but when I think about contributions that I pushed during the event ... Hum, what to say if so ... 
Their were not so many things to be proud of :sweat_smile:
But anyway, I was able to do my kind of first contributions to "open source" projects, and the feeling to help, to contribute to this
great cause were really satisfying.

Also and for most, I was able to get this beloved t-shirt : (insert photo)

# Next editions

For the next few years, I was not able to validate my participation to the event, sadly their were no new t-shirt to wear for me, it was terrible ...
or, maybe not in the end :grin:. 
All the things that I learned during the first edition allowed me to work easily in this OpenSource/Full Remote environment. 
It were now evident that contributing is most about sharing, learning about project than just writing some shitty code and push it into a random repository.
In some way, the exercise is very similar to what's happens when I began a mission for a new client as a consultant.

First it was important to familiarize within the project I wanted to contribute to. 
It was even more important as the projects that I want to contribute are project that are used by a lot of people and are way bigger 
than the ones I first targeted during the first event. 
Sometime, it was like my day-to-day job, when I came in a new client team, I had to take time to set up my dev environment to fit the needs of a specific project.
It's the same for an open source project. I mean you just have to read the doc, or try to tell the right people how to get started.

For example, I was at ease with Java or Javascript projects, but recently, I wanted to solve some issues with some tools that I were using daily like terraform.
So had to install a go environment (and to learn how to code with this langage... even if I promised myself to never touch this thing ... but ... well you know, it's everywhere now)

On the other hand, a contribution have to follow the project's own rules. Sometimes, I thought that I got the best idea of the year,
but sometimes this idea is just not following some principle, or the philosophy of a project I wanted to contribute to. Also it's important
to take the time to discuss the idea, to find the best way to do or not to do things, even if it seems relevant, sometimes, 
idea's can be at the opposite of the project target

Well, with those new set of minds, this few years I was able to do some contributions that I were really proud of. 
Those contributions were way better than the ones I've pushed during the first HacktoberFest event. 
It also took me a lot more time to handle the complexity of this type of projects.
Finally, I was not able to get the right amount of PR during the due period.
Anyway, I don't regret, this time I had contributed to projects that were used by more than two persons.
It was an awesome feeling, the feeling to be helpful in a kind of way.

# Why to persist participating ? 

Indeed, I was not able to get the t-shirt ! Well, I realized that the t-shirt itself gave me less satisfaction less pleasure than I experienced when I just "done my part" at my very own speed. 
So Why am I participating year-to-year to the event ?

Because I had fun the first time, and well ... each year since this one.

I hope that, I may be able to find something that will give me the chance to validate my participation. 
But well, I'm just not prolific enough (yet) in the OpenSource space to push the 4 PRs needed to validate my HacktoberFest participation.     
The rythme that I'm able to contribute is way more sporadic.

I think that the reason is not the fact that I can't create enough PR to validate the event. 
Instead, I wanted to push interesting PRs, on project that I daily use, and as I mention earlier, contributing for each of those project is a challenge itself.
Also, I mean, when I encounter an issue, well, I often not quite patient enough to wait for next October before starting working on solving it :sweat_smile:

As far as I can think about it, I feel like the reason why I wanted this t-shirt so much were in order to be identified,
or recognized as an OpenSource contributor. The reality is: when I wear a hacktoberfest t-shirt, I can't stop thinking myself:
Ok, younger me, so you've got this t-shirt, but finally are you proud of your OpenSource journey ? 
And of course the answer from younger me was No. 

# The discord

When I'm looking to the spamming of issues this past year, I felt very sad seeing this type of things. 
I mean, at the first glance, it was just a t-shirt. But when thinking about it, I realized that I can't criticize this conduct.
I mean, I'm lucky enough to have gathered a lot of tech t-shirts. Not all devs have this luck.
Furthermore, we, in occidental countries, are maybe a little privileged and just forgot to think globally.

When the scandal happened, I saw a lot of criticism about indian videos showing how to push some trash PR in order to validate the HacktoberFest participation.
Unfortunately, Indians average salaries are about 300 US Dollars a month, it's 4 time less than the average salary in France or US. A t-shirt like the one
we can earn with Hacktoberfest cost around 25 US Dollars ... it's near to 10 percent of the salary of an indian folk. 
10 percent of an average developer salary here is enough to by something like a Nintendo Switch... 
So should I be able to do some bad PR for this kind of reward. 
Hell yeah I think that I could do some effort for this :grin:

# Last thoughts

We have to be kind with this kind of drifting. Maybe folks that act this way are just less lucky than us.
Maybe, if luckily, this event can have a 2021 edition, I think that 
I will spend a lot of time helping new-comers being able to get their beloved t-shirts. 
It could be a cool time spending
