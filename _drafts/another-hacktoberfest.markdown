I'm really sad seeing what's happened in the Open Source community regarding the Hacktoberfest this year.
I mean, this event was designed to promote Open Source contributing. The idea is fairly simple and laudable.
So seeing conversations about spamming and other unfair practices that's causes a lot of maintainers to 
rage against this event, I first were a bit confused and began to think about the causes of this bad advertising.
I did not understand why it exists this kind of animosity around the event that allows me to begin my Open Source journey.

# My first participation.

The first time I participated, I were not use to the process of contributing on OpenSource project. 
To be honest, I think that I were not totally aware of what OpenSource was or the phylosophy behind that.

This past me were not really confident when writing a message into an issue and more precisely were terrifying to write things on github:
I thought, damn if somebody read this and ... you know maybe is this a big shitty comment or question ... 
maybe should I avoid write a thing on github since I'm not an expert on this specific thing I wanted to answer about.

present me to my past me: in the future you will not be an expert of anything so if you wait for it, 
you may have to wait for a long long time ... or maybe it will never happens 
Secondly: idiot, if you want to become an expert on something don't fear errors or stupid questions ... that seems to be a good way to learn

Happily SFEIR has organized an event around the hacktoberfest.
 
I joined the event with some friends and teammates and shared some good time contributing to each other's project. 
It was really satisfying to contribute to projects other than mine, we were able to discuss, to promote some projects and to get/give help
to each other.

So finally, I proudly (or not) got the chance to be one of the choosen t-shirt owner (well, past me thought that way)

Why am I saying proudly or not ? Well, it was a cool event, but when I thought about contributions I did that time ... Hum, what to say if so ... 
Their were not so many things to be proud of :sweat_smile:
But any way, I were able to do my first contributions to "open source" projects, and the feeling to help were really satisfying.
Also and for most, I were able to get this beloved t-shirt : (insert photo)

# Next editions

For the next few years, I were not able to validate my participation to the event, sadly no new tshirt to wear, it was terrible..
or not. 
The things I learned during the first edition allowed me to work easily in this OpenSource/Full Remote environment. 
It were now evident that contributing is most sharing, learning about project than just writing some shitty code and push it to a random repository.
In some way, the exercise is very similar to what's happens when I began a mission for a new client as a consultant.

First it was important to familiarize with the project I wanted to contribute to. 
It was even more important as the project I want to contribute to became bigger than before. 
Sometimes, like when welcomed into a new dev team, you have to take time to set up your dev environment to fit the needs of a specific project.
It was the same for a lot of project I targeted for this period. 

I were at ease with Java or Javascript projects, but as I wanted to solve some issues with e.g: terraform, I had to install a go environment
(and to learn how to code with this langage... even if I promised myself to never touch this thing ... it's everywhere)

In the second hand, a contribution have to follow the project's governance target. It's cool to arrive with the best idea of the year,
but sometimes this idea is just not following some principle, or the Mojo of the project you want to contribute to. Also it's important
to take the time to discuss the way to do things, or even if the thing you think about is relevant for the project.

Well, with those things in mind, this few years I was able to do some contributions that I were really proud of. 
A step furthers the one I've done during the first hacktoberfest event. But those contributions took me a lot more time to handle.
So I were not able to get the right amount of PR during the due period. But I don't regret, this time I had contributed to projects 
that were used by more than two persons. It was an awesome feeling, the feeling to be helpful in a kind of way.

# Why to persist participating ? 

Well, yes, I were not able to get the t-shirt, and it get me less satisfaction to get the t-shirt than to "do my part" at my own speed. 
So Why am I participating year-to-year to the event ?
