This is my very first post on this brand-new blog. In the past, I used some other ways to build it
but no one had really satisfied my needs: I wanted to publish the code and content on github and to host the site nearly for free
on any cloud provider or existing service... 

I found a lot of different ways to do this, but sometimes it was too long to build,
sometimes it was too expensive. None of the solutions I tested was as adapted to my needs as this current one.

Now, I use the simplest solution that I found : a simple github page! 
It seems to be simple to use, it's free (unless the domain name but this part is not the most expensive) 
and this time, all the content is saved in a git repository!

I'm really excited to begin, so : 

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    println!("Hello (in my) World!");
}
{% endhighlight %}

That's a new beginning ...
